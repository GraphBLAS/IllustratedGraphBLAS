## Summary

This chapter introduces incidence matrices as an alternative graph representation:

- **Incidence vs Adjacency** - Adjacency matrices have nodes as both rows and columns; incidence matrices have nodes as rows and edges as columns
- **Incidence Matrix Structure** - Each column represents an edge, with non-zero entries indicating which nodes participate in that edge
- **Matrix Multiplication with Incidence** - Multiplying incidence matrices to derive relationships and construct new graph structures
- **Multi-graphs** - Graphs with multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, naturally represented through incidence matrices
- **Hypergraphs** - Generalized graphs where edges can connect more than two nodes, enabling complex relationship modeling
- **Applications** - Network flow, bipartite matching, and modeling relationships that go beyond simple pairwise connections
